# diabetes_prediction

#Source: PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset

#Built an SVM-based model to predict diabetes using the PIMA dataset.

#Preprocessed data with scaling and trained/tested on an 80/20 split.

#Achieved ~78% accuracy on training and ~77% on test data.

#I used Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

#Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age

#Target: Diabetes Outcome (0: Non-diabetic, 1: Diabetic)

#Data Preprocessing: Feature scaling, Train-test split (There are no missing values in this dataset)
